	<center><h1> 1.1.9 Project - Build-a-Bear </h1></center>
    <center><h1>	We created an interactive game where you customize the colors of a bear and add accessories, which can also be customized with colors. </h1></center>

    <center><h1> 1.2.5 Project - Super Fun Cup Game </h1></center>
    <center><h1>	This game creates three cups, either blue or red, depending on the user's color choice and randomly selects one of the three cups to be special. The cups then shuffle and the user has two tries to guess which cup is special. If they guess wrong, one of the two hearts on the screen dissapears. Once they lose both hearts, they lose the game and it ends. If they guess the correct cup on the first or second try, then they win. </h1></center>

    <center><h1> 1.3.1 Project - Cat Life </h1></center>
    <center><h1>	We created a game on scratch that follows a cat named Jared. We have an intro story explaining how Jared got lost and is now in a meadow with some animals. The user can control Jared with arrow keys, and when he touches the animals, mini games launch so he can earn money. There is a bird that needs some money because his parents are sick, so once Jared has enough money for the bird he gives it to the bird and then a conclusion story plays and the bird's parents are cured and Jared gets back home. </h1></center>

    <center><h1>   3.1.6 Project - Rover Phone Home</h1>
    <center><h1>	A data recording rover got lost and scientists want to see if they can figure out where it is so they can retrieve and fix it. The rover recorded and sent data back about where it was, including temperature sound, wind speed, and light. The data was sent as an analogous sata set so we separated the data based on values and decimal places and then tried to firuge out which data set corresponded to which element. We found that the rover was somewhere with constant temperature, a small amount of wind, and constant sounds from animals, which matched the description of the marsh land. </h1></center>

    <center><h1>   3.2.4 Project - Making Meaning from Data</h1>
    <center><h1>	We were given a huge data set and were trying to find patterns with the honey production of each state. We cleaned the data so we only had the data we absolutely needed. Then we used Python to further sort and combine values in the list so we could plot them on matplotlib graphs in the program. We did this a few different ways and ended up with a lot of different graphs expressing the total, mean, and yearly production of honey. </h1></center>

    <h1>   4.1.4 Project- Understanding Complex Systems .</h1>
    <center><h1>	We looked at a simulation on NetLogo that showed two patients with bacterial infections. We could control how often the bacteria reproduced as well as how much and how often antibiotics were given to kill the bacteria. Randomness was used to place the bacteria, determine how many holes the bacteria had in the cell membrane, and how the antibiotics floated around in the bloodstream. However the simulation did not include whether or not the patients took care of themselves, how strong their immune systems were, or how bacteria can adapt to be resistant to antibiotics.
